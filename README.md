## Cloudflare transform rules url rewrites
#### For example we need transform (not redirect) 
#### Subfolder domain from monolith: /v1/auth/pass/email to microservice: /v2/auth/pass/email
#### Very helpful for migrating to microservices without having to release a new mobile app 
- `only posible with the same subdomain`
- `very helpful for migration from monolith to microservice, no worry with old version app use old url`
