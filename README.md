## cloudflare transform rules url rewrites
### For example we need transform (not redirect) Subfolder domain from monolith:/v1/auth/pass/email to microservice:/v2/auth/pass/email
- `only posible with the same subdomain`
- `very helpful for migration from monolith to microservice, no worry with old version app use old url`
